# A_Fish_Prompt

This is a basic prompt for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)

## Usage:

Replace ```~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish```

There are some commented out theme examples in the file as the colours are hardcoded.

**NOTE**: This prompt by default uses characters from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/),

and you will need a font that has been patched with them such as Iosevka Nerd

### Removal:

Reverting the theme can be done with [fish_config](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_config.html)
